WITNESS STATEMENT

Case Number: INV-2023-8821
Date: August 3, 2023
Witness: Michael Roberts, IT Manager

STATEMENT:

I am providing this statement regarding the data breach incident on July 28, 2023.

On that date, I was working from home as per our remote work policy. At approximately 2:15 PM, I received an alert from our security monitoring system indicating unusual database access patterns.

I immediately logged into the admin console and noticed that someone with Sarah Martinez's credentials was downloading large volumes of customer records. This was unusual because:

1. Sarah was on vacation that week (July 24-30)
2. The access was from an IP address in Romania, not our office or approved VPN
3. The query patterns were systematic - extracting tables in alphabetical order

I contacted Sarah via her personal phone at 2:30 PM. She confirmed she was on vacation and had NOT accessed any company systems. She also mentioned that she had received a phishing email on July 20 asking her to "verify her credentials" but she had ignored it and deleted it.

I immediately:
- Disabled Sarah's account at 2:35 PM
- Blocked the Romanian IP address
- Initiated our incident response protocol
- Notified my supervisor, David Chen, at 2:40 PM

By my analysis, approximately 45,000 customer records were accessed before I stopped the breach. The data included names, email addresses, and purchase history, but NOT credit card information (that's stored separately with encryption).

I preserved all server logs and access records as evidence.

I believe this was a credential phishing attack that succeeded because Sarah clicked on a link in that July 20 email, despite her claim that she "deleted it."

Signed,
Michael Roberts
