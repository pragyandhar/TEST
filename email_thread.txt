Team,

I want to clarify some confusion around remote work. Despite the June memo, our department does NOT allow fully remote work. Remote work is limited to 2 days per week maximum, and only for certain roles.

Please disregard the June memo—it was not approved by all department heads. Continue following Remote Work Policy v2.0 as the official guideline.

Regards,
Sarah

Sarah,

The June memo IS official. All departments must comply. We understand there may be confusion, but the company has made a strategic shift to fully remote-first operations.

Regards,
HR

This is inconsistent with what I was told in my manager briefing. I will need written confirmation.

Both parties: 

The official remote work policy for 2023 is v2.0. The June memo was issued prematurely and should not be referenced. All employees should follow v2.0 guidelines until a formal policy update is issued.

We apologize for the confusion.
