EMPLOYEE STATEMENT - REBUTTAL

From: Sarah Martinez, Senior Database Administrator
Date: August 7, 2023
RE: Data Breach Incident - My Response to Allegations

I am writing to formally contest the allegations made in the Security Incident Report (SEC-2023-0728-BREACH).

FACTS:

1. I DID receive a suspicious email on July 20. I immediately recognized it as phishing and deleted it without clicking any links.

2. I DID NOT enter my credentials on any external website. The web proxy logs cited in the report are incorrect or have been misinterpreted.

3. I WAS on approved vacation July 24-30. I had no access to company systems during this time.

4. My laptop remained at home during vacation. I did not take it with me.

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION:

I believe my credentials were compromised through a different vector, possibly:
- Malware on a shared company computer
- Keylogger on conference room equipment
- Insider threat with access to credential stores
- Previous breach of password database

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING MY POSITION:

1. I have used strong, unique passwords for all company systems (verified via password manager logs)
2. I have completed all required security training with 100% scores
3. I have a clean employment record with zero prior security incidents in 5 years
4. I reported 3 previous phishing attempts in 2022 (tickets SEC-2022-0145, SEC-2022-0298, SEC-2022-0412)

REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION:

I formally request:
1. Independent forensic analysis of the web proxy logs
2. Review of all access to credential stores and administrative systems
3. Investigation of other potential breach vectors
4. Polygraph test (I volunteer)

The current report appears to rush to conclusions without fully investigating all possibilities. I am being scapegoated for a systemic security failure.

I have retained legal counsel and request that all disciplinary actions be suspended pending a thorough and impartial investigation.

Respectfully submitted,
Sarah Martinez
